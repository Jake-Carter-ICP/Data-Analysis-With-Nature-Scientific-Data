"NOTE: The cells with values of NM in the ETH_CropSoilData_Raw sheet indicate chemical properties or concentrations were not measured. Cells labelled NA in the ETH_CropSoilData_NA sheet means the chemical properties or concentrations were either not measured, below the limit of detection (LOD), or negative. ",,,,,,,,
